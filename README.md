# _Coin Combination_
#### _Testing Practice_
#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Description

This exercise was designed in C#, mostly meant for me to practice writing tests, but also a console app for users to enjoy. The User is prompted to enter an decimal number up to the decimal hundredths place(like money) and the program returns the least amount of coins and each coin name that adds up to the users amount.
i.e. `.99` will return `quarters: 3. dimes: 2. nickels: 0. pennies: 4.`

## Setup/Installation Requirements

In the terminal, `cd ` to the directory folder.

Then `cd` to `CoinCombo` folder.

Run `dotnet run` to compile and be prompted shortly after.

Enjoy!
